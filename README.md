TerraFlaskQLK8s 🐶 – Your Daily Beagle Treat!
This project leverages a comprehensive, containerized CI/CD pipeline built on GitHub Actions for automated integration, testing, and deployment. The application is built into a Docker image, validated with Docker Compose, and deployed to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using Helm and Terraform. Real-time monitoring is provided via Prometheus and Grafana to ensure peak performance and reliability.

Overview
TerraFlaskQLK8s delivers a fully automated, scalable, and monitored deployment solution for your Flask application. Key highlights include:

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated code build, test, and deployment via GitHub Actions.
Containerization: Dockerized application ensuring a consistent runtime.
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform provisions the GKE cluster, while Helm manages Kubernetes deployments.
Monitoring & Security: Prometheus, Grafana, and automated alerts safeguard application performance.
Project Flow

(Replace with your project flow diagram if available.)

Code Commit & Trigger:
Every code push to the repository triggers the GitHub Actions pipeline.

Build Stage:

Checkout & Authentication: Code is checked out and Docker Hub credentials are used.
Docker Image Build: A new Docker image is built (without cache), tagged as latest, and pushed to Docker Hub.
Build-Test Stage:

Environment Setup: Code is re-checked out and required environment variables are set.
Local Testing: Docker Compose spins up a multi-container environment; a curl test verifies the application.
Helm Stage:

Chart Update: The Helm chart version is updated from version.txt, packaged, and pushed to the Helm repository.
Terraform & Deployment Stage:

Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform creates/updates the GKE cluster (with remote state and locking).
Application Deployment: Helm deploys the updated Docker image to the cluster, refreshing Kubernetes resources.
Monitoring Verification:
Prometheus (installed via kube-prometheus-stack) scrapes application metrics to ensure monitoring is active and accurate.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

Python 3.8+
Docker & Docker Compose
GitHub Actions enabled in your repository
Terraform
Helm
Required Secrets & Variables
Configure the following in your GitHub repository under Actions > Secrets & Variables:

Secrets:
dockeruser: Your Docker Hub username.
dockertoken: Docker Hub access token.
GCP_CREDENTIALS: Google Cloud Service Account key (JSON).
MYSQL_PASSWORD: MySQL password.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: MySQL root password.
Additional secrets as needed (e.g., AWS credentials, Helm repo PAT).
Variables:
DOCKER_REPO: Your Docker Hub repository name.
GKE_CLUSTER_NAME: Your GKE cluster name.
PROJECT_ID: Your Google Cloud project ID.
REGION: The GCP region for your cluster.
Quick Start
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/terraflaskqlk8s.git
cd terraflaskqlk8s
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Locally:

bash
Copy
flask run
Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Local Docker Test:

bash
Copy
docker compose up --build
Verify with:

bash
Copy
curl http://localhost:5000
CI/CD Process Breakdown
Code Commit & Pipeline Trigger:
GitHub Actions detects changes and initiates the pipeline.

Build Stage:

Image Build: Docker image is built and tagged as latest.
Image Push: The built image is pushed to Docker Hub for consistency.
Build-Test Stage:

Environment Setup & Testing: Docker Compose tests the multi-container setup with a curl command to verify functionality.
Artifact Upload: Critical artifacts (e.g., IMAGE_TAG) are stored for later stages.
Helm Stage:

Chart Update & Packaging: The Helm chart is updated based on version.txt and packaged for deployment.
Terraform & Deploy Stage:

Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform provisions the GKE cluster with remote state management.
Application Deployment: Helm deploys the new Docker image to Kubernetes.
Verify-Monitoring Stage:

Monitoring Setup: Prometheus scrapes the /metrics endpoint.
Alerting: Alerts (e.g., via email) are configured for critical thresholds.
Docker & Containerization
Dockerfile:
Defines the base image, installs dependencies, copies source files, and sets necessary environment variables.

Docker Compose:
Facilitates local testing. Run:

bash
Copy
docker compose up --build
Then verify with:

bash
Copy
curl http://localhost:<PORT>
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Terraform provisions the GKE cluster and manages remote state (e.g., using Google Cloud Storage).
Run:

bash
Copy
terraform init
terraform apply
Kubernetes & Helm
Helm manages Kubernetes deployments, including:

Deployment: Uses templates to create/update Kubernetes resources.
Service Exposure: Configures a Kubernetes Service for external access.
Monitoring Integration: Configures Prometheus scraping via Helm.
Helm Commands:

Install:
bash
Copy
helm install $HELM_RELEASE_NAME ./helm-chart --namespace <NAMESPACE>
Upgrade:
bash
Copy
helm upgrade $HELM_RELEASE_NAME ./helm-chart
Uninstall:
bash
Copy
helm uninstall $HELM_RELEASE_NAME --namespace <NAMESPACE>
Security & Monitoring
Security Considerations
Secrets Management:
Store sensitive data (credentials, tokens) as GitHub Secrets.
Network Policies:
Implement Kubernetes network policies to control traffic.
Monitoring Setup
Prometheus & Grafana:
The application exposes metrics on /metrics, which are scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.
Alerting:
Email alerts trigger when critical thresholds (e.g., visitor count > 4000) are exceeded.
Cleanup Procedures
To manage resources and control storage costs, cleanup scripts are provided:

Docker Hub Cleanup
Remove outdated or untagged Docker images:

bash
Copy
bash cleanups/docker-hub-cleanup.sh
